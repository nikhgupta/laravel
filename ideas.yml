Ideas:
  - place a file in the ~/.laravel folder for every application being created
    - helps in keeping a counter
    - keeps a setting of the application that was created
  - use yaml settings for the gem which is overridden by a local yaml settings file
    - faster installs and deployments
  - generalized configuration
  - generalized installation
    - tasks
    - bundles
